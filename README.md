# Portfolio
https://jasminh-portfolio.netlify.app/

In this project I have created a portfolio highlighting my background, skills, most interesting projects and articles. It has been built with React and I have used semantic HTML, followed a design in Figma, structured into larg files as well as smaller files - like components, used aria labels and styled components.
